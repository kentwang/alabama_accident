Accident Data: Things to do

Make exploratory plots
 - number of accidents at intersections
 - accident rate at intersections (5Y accidents / avg traffic (in millions) )

Build predictive models
	Note: two models for each. One with offset (avg traffic (in millions)) and one without (but use these variables as predictor variables)
 - poisson regression
 - overdispersed poisson (negbin or quasipois)
 - rpart
 - random forest (Q: does random forest allow an offset?)
 
Examine Residuals
 - make various residual plots
 - how to define residual for count data: raw (obs-exp), standardized, deviance, etc
 
Explanatory Analysis
 - what are most important predictors from each model?
 - should we use lasso penalty on regression models?
 
Cross-Validation
 - Perhaps we should use cross-validation instead of regular residual analysis
 - special cross-validation based on intersections and legs
